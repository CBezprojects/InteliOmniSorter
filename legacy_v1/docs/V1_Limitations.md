# SmartSorter Pro V1 â€” Limitations

## 1. Not Modular
Logic was spread across scripts without separation of concerns.

## 2. Large Binary Dependencies
dlib and wheels could not be committed to GitHub.

## 3. Scattered Sorting Logic
Routing rules existed in multiple places.

## 4. No Automatic Rollback
Logs existed, but no built-in undo system.

## 5. Primitive Auto-Mount
Unreliable polling method.

## 6. Script-Based Interface
No GUI toolkit.

## 7. Difficult Packaging
Mixed PowerShell and Python.

## 8. Windows-Only
Pathing and dependencies were not cross-platform.

These limitations shaped V2â€™s modular redesign.
